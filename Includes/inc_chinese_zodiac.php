	<!-- Chinese Zodiac information text -->

	<p>The Chinese Zodiac, known as Sheng Xiao, is a calendar based on the 11.86 year cycle of the orbit of Jupiter. "Legend has it that one day the gods ordered that animals be designated as signs of each year and the twelve that arrived first were selected..." ("Chinese Zodiac", n.d.). Each year is has its own sign related to an animal. The signs are the rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog and pig. This system was originially created to help count years during the Han Dynasty (202BC - 220AD). There has been a relationship between human and the 12 zodiacal animals. It is believed that the years represented by the animals affect the characters (and living habits) of people in the same way that people believe the western astrology signs do. "The old-time division was mostly related to number 12: one ji equals 12 years, one year has 12 months, one day has 12 time periods called shi chen" ("Chinese Zodiac", n.d.). Astrological in nature, ancient peoples also observed that there are twelve full moons in each year. Calculation of Chinese zodiac signs is based on the lunar calendar. This 'animal year' is known as the individual's Ben Ming Nian. Traditionally, Chinese people take their year of birth very seriously primarily due to a fear that people in their own Ben Ming Nian may offend "Taisui" - the God of Age. This offense is punishable by many misfortunes, such as sickness, economic loss, physical injuries and obstacles in career. Strangely, it is believed that wearing red underwear, red socks, and a red belt can ward off Taisui, as red brings good luck ("Chinese Zodiac", n.d.).</p>
