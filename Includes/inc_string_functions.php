		<p>This assignment looks for the similarity between the chinese zodiac sign names through the use of two functions: levenshtein() and similar_text(). These two functions are very different. The similar_text() function gives a result based on how similar looking two words are, where the levenshtein() function gives a result based on the least number of letters that would need to be changed. Test the script to see what I mean!</p>
